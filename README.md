The Multi-View 3D Visual Effects
## Abstract
This assignment want to leverage feature extraction and matching technique using OpenCV to generate some of the multi-view 3D visual effects, such as motion parallax, live photo, and so on. We proposed three 3D visual effects and show the results in below.
## 1. Take multi-view images by yourselves
### a. Motion parallax
- Link:
### b. Stop motion
- Link:
### c. Live photo
- Link:
## 2. Show image alignment results between different images
## 3. Generate the multi-view 3D visual effects
- Motion parallax

## 4. Exploit creativity to add some image processing to enhance effect
- Image blurring
- Edge enhancement
## 5. Bonus - Complete the above 2 different effects
- Stop motion
- Live photo
